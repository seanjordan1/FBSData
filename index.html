      <p>College football is one of the biggest moneymakers in sports. One of the titans of the sports world, college football is a powerful source of revenue generation. College football is a financial powerhouse that has no limits, from sold-out stadiums that hum with the passion of devoted fans to enormous broadcasting deals that span multiple national networks. Fueled by the fierce rivalries and legendary traditions that enthrall audiences across the country, merchandise sales, ticket revenues, and sponsorships all contribute to the massive financial empire. College football continues to hold a strong hold on the sports economy, making it one of the most profitable endeavors in sports, even as bowl games and playoffs become cultural phenomena.</p>
      <p>Over time, recruiting within the Football Subdivision has experienced a radical transformation, changing from a primarily localized and relationship-based process to a high-tech, data-driven machine. In the past, coaches mainly relied on word-of-mouth recommendations, scouting trips, and personal connections to find hidden gems. But things have changed since the introduction of digital platforms and analytics. In order to find and court elite talent, coaches now use sophisticated metrics, video analysis, and social media outreach in the recruiting process. The emergence of recruiting services, camps, and showcases has increased competition, hastened the hiring process, and made it an annual endeavor. Additionally, the transfer portal has changed the game by providing coaches with a new way to find talent and athletes with never-before-seen mobility.</p>
      <p>With the relatively recent introduction to NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) from the world of collegiate athletics, recruiting has completely changed. </p>

      <p>Since NIL was rendered effective in July 2021, these FBS programs have spent a record number of money on recruiting, reaching $174,000,000. It is no secret that the evolving landscape of college football, including changes in transfer regulations and NIL legislation, has influenced recruiting strategies and spending priorities. As schools adapt to these developments and navigate their implications for recruiting, they may allocate additional resources to stay abreast of evolving trends and opportunities in player acquisition.</p>
      <p>Now FBS is not the only division in college football that spends money on recruiting. </p>

      <p>The FCS has been spending more money on recruiting as well, albeit nowhere near the amount as FBS programs.</p>
      <p>Recruiting over the past few years has absolutely changed the landscape of college football and will continue to in the future. With the data provided, I think that much is blatantly true. </p>
